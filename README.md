# LoadBalancing
Learning LoadBalancing and creating a load balancer from scratch.

## Description
In this project, I'am going to try to learn the basics of load blancing, and try to make a load balancer from scratch.

During the learning/developement process, I'am going to include any usefull information in this Readme markdown file including any usefull source, and so this can serve as a set of flashback cards and why not help any other person interested to learn about the subject.

## Prerequisites 
Before to start lets take a look at some information, descriptions and definitions that might be required before starting to tackle main subject.

### What is a workload?
    In computing, the workload is the amount of processing that the computer has been given to do at a given time. The workload consists of some amount of application programming running in the computer and usually some number of users connected to and interacting with the computer's applications.

#### An amount of labor
    Workload is the amount of work an individual has to do. There is a distinction between the actual amount of work and the individual's perception of the workload. Workload can also be classified as quantitative (the amount of work to be done) or qualitative (the difficulty of the work). Source: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workload]

In general, we can think of a workload as a function or method to be executed in a computing resource.

### What is a load balancer?
    In computing, load balancing improves the distribution of workloads across multiple computing resources, such as computers, a computer cluster, network links, central processing units, or disk drives. Load balancing aims to optimize resource use, maximize throughput, minimize response time, and avoid overload of any single resource. Using multiple components with load balancing instead of a single component may increase reliability and availability through redundancy. Load balancing usually involves dedicated software or hardware, such as a multilayer switch or a Domain Name System server process.
